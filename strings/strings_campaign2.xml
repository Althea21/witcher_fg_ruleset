A fumble can lower the roll, and a negative value means that not only do you fail to make any coin but you are also harrassed by the locals for your poor performance, resulting in a -2 to Charisma with anyone in the town for the rest of the day.</string>
	<string name="char_prof_skill_returnAct_desc">Before attempting a Busking roll a Bard can roll Return Act at a DC set by the GM to see whether they have played in this town before. If the roll is successful the Bard has made a name for themselves in this town already. Not only is their Busking income doubled but they gain a +2 Charisma with everyone in at that venue.</string>
	<string name="char_prof_skill_raiseACrowd_desc">By taking a full round to perform, you can roll Raise A Crowd to captivate anyone within 20m.

If attacked a target will snap out of it.</string>
	<string name="char_prof_skill_goodFriend_desc">Once per session a Bard can make a Good Friend roll to find a friend to aid them.

	<string name="char_prof_skill_fade_desc">A Bard can make a Fade roll against multiple targets' Awareness rolls to fade into the background.

This ability doesn't work if you are wearing really flashy clothing.</string>
	<string name="char_prof_skill_spreadTheWord_desc">A Bard who rolls a successful Deceit roll against a target can then roll Spread the Word against the target's Resist Coercion roll.

	<string name="char_prof_skill_acclimatize_desc">When in a settlement a Bard can roll Acclimatize (See Acclimatize chart for DC).

	<string name="char_prof_skill_needling_desc">A Bard can make a Needling roll against a target's Resist Coercion roll.

	<string name="char_prof_skill_etTuBrute_desc">A Bard can roll Et Tu Brute against a target's WILLx3 to turn them against one ally. If successful the Bard's lies and half-truths makes the target treat that ally with mistrust and animosity for as many days as the Et Tu Brute value or until they make a Resist Coercion roll that beats the Et Tu Brute roll.</string>
	<string name="char_prof_skill_patchJob_desc">A skilled craftsman can patch a weapon or armor well enough to keep it working and keep its wearer/wielder in the fight, whether that be by tying a bowstring back together, sharpening the edge of a broken blade, or nailing a plate over a cracked shield.

Until fixed at a forge, a patched weapon does half its normal damage.</string>
	<string name="char_prof_skill_extensiveCatalogue_desc">A skilled Craftsman can keep a mental catalogue of diagrams in their head at all times.

	<string name="char_prof_skill_mentalPharmacy_desc">A skilled Craftsman can keep a mental catalogue of formulae in their head at all times.

	<string name="char_prof_skill_doubleDose_desc">Any time a craftsman sets out to make an alchemical item they can make a Double Dose roll at a DC equal to the formula's crafting DC.

	<string name="char_prof_skill_adaptation_desc">Craftsmen can roll an Adaptation check (3 + the crafting DC) before making a witcher potion to lower its DC to avoid poisoning by 1 for every point over the crafting DC.

	<string name="char_prof_skill_augmentation_desc">A Craftsman can make an Augmentation roll at a DC listed in the Augmentation chart to augment a weapon or Armor with their crafting tools.

	<string name="char_prof_skill_practicedParanoia_desc">Whether they're an assassin, a thief, a counterfeitter, or a smuggler, criminals all share a practiced paranoia that keeps them out of trouble. Whenever a Criminal comes within 10m of a trap (this includes experimental traps, Man at Arms booby traps, and ambushes) they immediately can make a Practiced Paranoia roll at either the DC to spot the trap, the ambushing party's Stealth roll, or a DC set by the GM.
